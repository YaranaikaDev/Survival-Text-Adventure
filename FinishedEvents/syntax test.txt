<(S)>
Walking through the forest, you hear a twig snap behind you. Turning towards the
noise you see a flash of brown dart through the trees. Startled, you stand still
for a moment, giving the animal ample time to get further away. Looking to the
ground you notice that there are blood stains.

Give chase
<(Sb)>
Search the area
<(Sc)>
Move on

<(1A)>
Following the blood trail you quickly find its end. You don’t see anything in 
your immediate view but you do hear a something panting nearby.
<(/A)>
<(Aa)>
Investigate
<(Ab)>
Move on

<(A1A)>
Approaching the sound, you discover that it’s being made by a wolf clutching a 
dead rabbit in its jaws. The wolf lunges at you and cuts your left arm as you 
raise it to defend yourself. The wolf then makes its escape.

<(A2A)> 
Approaching the sound, you discover a young fawn that is badly bloodied. It 
seems too tired to run any further.
<(/A2A)>
<(A2Aa)>
Kill the deer
<(A2Ab)>
Move on

<(A2A1A)>
You manage to find a stone with a decent edge to it. It takes a lot of effort
but you manage to cut the deer’s throat and let it bleed out. Once the deer 
has finally expired you use the stone to roughly remove what meat and fur that
you can and eat it raw. 
[hunger down]
[end]
<(/A2A1A)>

<(A2A2A)>
Looking around all you can find to kill the deer is a sizeable stone. You use it
to bash in the fawn’s head. It takes longer than you would’ve wished and in the 
end you realize that you don’t have any real means to butcher it. What a fucking
waste.
[end]
<(/A2A2A)>

<(A2A2B)>
Though you feel sorry for the animal, you don’t really see it being worth the 
effort since you don’t have any proper tools to actually butcher it once you’ve
killed it. You decide to keep moving. 
[end]
<(/A2A2B)>

<(2A)>
Following the blood trail you quickly find its end. You scan the area but don’t
see anything and there’s no tracks that might hint as to where the animal went.
You search the surrounding area but fail to find anything, it seems you’ve 
completely lost track of whatever it was. There’s no sense in wasting more time. 
[end]
<(/2A)>

<(1B)>
Scouring the area you find a dead rabbit. It’s been partially eaten but there 
appears to be some meat left. It’s unclear if it was killed by the animal you 
just saw and you can’t really tell how long it’s been lying out here.
<(/1B)>
<(1Ba)>
Eat the rabbit
<(1Bb)>
Move on

<(1B1A)>
You rip out what chunks of meat you can with your hands and eat them. While it’s
hard to chew and the taste isn’t all that appetizing, it seems that your stomach 
is handling it all right and it feels good to have at least something to eat. 
[hunger down]
[end]
<(/1B1A)>

<(1B2A)>
You rip out what chunks of meat you can with your hands and eat them. The meat 
is softer than you would’ve expected and while you’re not used to eating raw
meat, something seems off about the taste. After you’ve finished and continue 
moving you start to feel your stomach cramp. It eventually gets to the point 
where you double over in pain and vomit out what you’ve just eaten. It seems 
that you’re now hungrier than you were before you ate the rabbit.
[hunger up]
[end]
<(/1B2A)>

<(1BB)>
While food is hard to come by, you hardly feel it’s worth it to take the chance 
on this rabbit. You decide to keep moving.
[end]
<(/1BB)>

<(2B)>
Though you look high and low, your efforts are fruitless. You can’t find 
anything of interest in the area and decide to keep moving. 
[end]
<(/2B)>

<(1C)>
*Move on [Outcome 1]:  While the prospect of a potential meal is enticing, you 
decide it’s better to keep moving.
[end]
<(/1C)>

<(2C)>
[unlikely]
Not wanting to waste time on chasing the animal you decide to keep moving, after
a short time you begin to hear footfalls rapidly approaching . You wheel around
only to see a wolf already lunging at you with it’s gaping maw. You barely 
manage to raise your arm in an attempt to defend yourself and the wolf’s jaw 
clamps down hard on it. With your free arm you attempt to wrestle free as the 
wolf thrashes it’s head back and forth, widening the wounds. You eventually get
yourself free of the wolf and sprint as hard as you can, barely managing to escape
from the wolf.
